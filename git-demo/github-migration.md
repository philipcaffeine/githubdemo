Planning your migration to GitHub

## Learn how to plan and execute a successful migration to GitHub or between GitHub products.

## Defining your origin and destination

## Building a basic inventory of the repositories you want to migrate

##  Measuring the sizes of your repositories

If you’re using Git as your version control system, it's not only large files currently in the repository that matter; large files in your repository's history matter too. For example, if you had a file larger than 100MB in your repository in the past, then that file will still be present in your Git history, unless you’ve rewritten the history to remove all traces of the file. 

For more information about rewriting history, see About large files on GitHub
